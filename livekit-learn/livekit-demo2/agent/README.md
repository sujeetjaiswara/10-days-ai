# LiveKit Agents Starter - Node.js

A complete starter project for building voice AI apps with [LiveKit Agents for Node.js](https://github.com/livekit/agents-js) and [LiveKit Cloud](https://cloud.livekit.io/).

The starter project includes:

- A simple voice AI assistant, ready for extension and customization
- A voice AI pipeline with [models](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/models) from OpenAI, Cartesia, and AssemblyAI served through LiveKit Cloud
  - Easily integrate your preferred [LLM](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/models/llm/), [STT](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/models/stt/), and [TTS](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/models/tts/) instead, or swap to a realtime model like the [OpenAI Realtime API](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/models/realtime/openai)
- [LiveKit Turn Detector](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/build/turns/turn-detector/) for contextually-aware speaker detection, with multilingual support
- [Background voice cancellation](https://docs.livekit.io/home/cloud/noise-cancellation/)
- Integrated [metrics and logging](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/build/metrics/)
- A Dockerfile ready for [production deployment](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/ops/deployment/)

This starter app is compatible with any [custom web/mobile frontend](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/start/frontend/) or [SIP-based telephony](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/start/telephony/).

## Dev Setup

This project uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as the package manager.

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```console
cd agent-starter-node
pnpm install
```

Sign up for [LiveKit Cloud](https://cloud.livekit.io/) then set up the environment by copying `.env.example` to `.env.local` and filling in the required keys:

- `LIVEKIT_URL`
- `LIVEKIT_API_KEY`
- `LIVEKIT_API_SECRET`

You can load the LiveKit environment automatically using the [LiveKit CLI](https://docs.livekit.io/home/cli/cli-setup):

```bash
lk cloud auth
lk app env -w -d .env.local
```

## Run the agent

Before your first run, you must download certain models such as [Silero VAD](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/build/turns/vad/) and the [LiveKit turn detector](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/build/turns/turn-detector/):

```console
pnpm run download-files
```

To run the agent during development, use the `dev` command:

```console
pnpm run dev
```

In production, use the `start` command:

```console
pnpm run start
```

## Using this template repo for your own project

Once you've started your own project based on this repo, you should:

1. **Check in your `pnpm-lock.yaml`**: This file is currently untracked for the template, but you should commit it to your repository for reproducible builds and proper configuration management. (The same applies to `livekit.toml`, if you run your agents in LiveKit Cloud)

2. **Remove the git tracking test**: Delete the "Check files not tracked in git" step from `.github/workflows/tests.yml` since you'll now want this file to be tracked. These are just there for development purposes in the template repo itself.

## Deploying to production

This project is production-ready and includes a working `Dockerfile`. To deploy it to LiveKit Cloud or another environment, see the [deploying to production](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/ops/deployment/) guide.

## Self-hosted LiveKit

You can also self-host LiveKit instead of using LiveKit Cloud. See the [self-hosting](https://docs.livekit.io/home/self-hosting/) guide for more information. If you choose to self-host, you'll need to also use [model plugins](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/models/#plugins) instead of LiveKit Inference and will need to remove the [LiveKit Cloud noise cancellation](https://docs.livekit.io/home/cloud/noise-cancellation/) plugin.
